Repository of the Skype Connector Published on the Myo Market

This connector allows you to control the following features of your web browser:

- Call contact from open chat window and hang up
- Navigate through conversation windows (Mac only)
- Adjust call volume while in active call (Mac only)

Tested in Skype on Mac OS X Yosemite.

Please note: Some features are designated 'Mac Only' because the Windows version doesn't have the keyboard shortcuts assigned. A future version will allow the connector to be given keyboard shortcuts, however these will also need to be added to Skype's settings.
